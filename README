v_Si.traj : validation set 


* The base model is too large data to upload. So please refer to the Dropbox.


[ auto_train_bcm_score.sh ]
* If use "auto_train_bcm_score.sh", you can train sub-models and predict values(energies and forces of validation set) through BCM.
  And you can automatically train each models and predict values(using BCM) using *diff=0.4 -> *diff=0.1 -> *diff=0.01, sequentially. 
* But you need to modify some parameters of this script depending on your environment.
* In this version, even if the model.pckl file was not generated at *diff=0.4, the model will be automatically trained using *diff=0.1 in the next step.
